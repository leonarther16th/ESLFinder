<% qa = [{title: "Strategy", q: "What is the pricing strategy that the eslBooking system uses?", a: "eslBooking uses the Yield Management Pricing Strategy which has been used successfully by the airline and hotel industries for the last 15 years."},{title: "Strategy", q: "Is eslBooking the first system that applies Yield Management in the ESL industry?", a: "Yes. The eslBooking system is the first of its kind in the educational industry."}, {title: "Strategy", q: "Why does the eslBooking system use Yield Management?", a: "Yield Management helps in providing dynamic prices to sell the right capacity (seats) to the right agents at the right price. Without limited capacity, Yield Management  can’t be used."}, {title: "Strategy", q: "What is the business environment where Yield Management can help?", a: "Environments where there is the ability to segment markets, where there is a perishable inventory, where there are advanced sales, where there is fluctuating demand, and where there is an accurate information system (eslBooking)."}, {title: "Sales", q: "Can students use or browse the eslBooking offers?", a: "No. This version is for agent and school use only."}, {title: "Sales", q: "What is the best timing to find the best available deals?", a: "There is no specific timing for the best available deals. Three factors control a school’s pricing strategy; number of empty seats in an existing class, timing of empty seats in existing classes and kind of existing course where there are empty seats."}, {title: "Sales", q: "Can I use eslBooking for last minute sales?", a: "Prices are offered based on available seats which can't be predicted by booking early or in the last minute. Offers may be available for students looking for last minute deals, however, they can’t be guaranteed."}, {title: "Sales", q: "Can I book more than one offer per student?", a: "You can book more than one eslBooking offer for ONE student if you find them, but be mindful of the start date of each offer. This is a “Bundled Offer,” so you need to email the school director to manually issue one letter of acceptance and one invoice."}, {title: "Sales", q: "I want to show students eslBooking prices on my computer, but don’t want them to see the original prices. What can I do?", a: "You can use the tab called “Pricing Setting” from the top “Setting” icon to increase the prices offered by the percentage you wish (i.e.: 5%, 10%, ..30%..). At eslBooking we protect your price privacy."}, {title: "Sales", q: "I want to book a group. How can I do this?", a: "Book your students individually as soon as you can before someone else purchases from the available seats. Once the booking is made then please contact the campus director directly to create and issue a group quotation (including all services that you may require)."}, {title: "Sales", q: "Can I book several student offers at one time?", a: "In order to ensure accuracy you must book each offer individually."}, {title: "Sales", q: "Can an offer ever be extended past the deadline?", a: "No, they cannot."}, {title: "Sales", q: "Can I contact the school directly to see if I can get a better deal than what’s offered on eslBooking?", a: "Yes, you can. However, deals cannot be combined."}, {title: "Sales", q: "I understand that deals cannot be combined, but if a school is offering a gift to the student (such as an iPhone or Visa gift card), can this student gift be combined with the eslBooking offer?", a: "No, they cannot. The eslBooking price is final and cannot be combined with any other existing offers or promotions."}, {title: "Sales", q: "Is the school’s current refund policy applicable to eslBooking offers?", a: "Yes."}, {title: "Sales", q: "Who pays me commission, eslBooking or the school? ", a: "No commission will be paid out to agents. Instead, agents will be deducting their profit before sending the tuition fees to the school."}, {title: "Sales", q: "I understand from the above question that I must pay the fees to the school after deducting my commission, however, I would like my student to send the money (including my profit) to the school. Can the school send me my commission / profit?", a: "Yes. Please send your invoice (including the eslBooking reference code) for payment to be processed."}, {title: "Sales", q: "What price should I charge my student? It is not clear if there is a net or gross price?", a: "By looking at any offer you will notice a price in green. This price is the price that an agent will pay to the school. No commission, discounts, or offers will be paid back from that amount. Below the “Book now” button (blue) is the recommended student price (red). This is the recommended price that we ask you to charge your student. The difference between the green and the red price is your profit."}, {title: "Sales", q: "Can I increase the offer price (in green) and therefore my profit?", a: "Yes. You can increase your profit by increasing the price in green (you can automatically do that by changing the pricing setting as explained above). It is required that you do not lower the student price (red) lower than the recommended price."}, {title: "Sales", q: "Can I hide the recommended price?", a: "Yes. Just go to ‘Pricing Setting’ under the ‘Setting icon’ at the top menu, then you can click on ‘Hide suggested student price.’"}, {title: "Sales", q: "What if I don’t find the deal I want? For example: I want to book a student for 24 weeks in Toronto, in the third week of January, but there are no offers available.", a: "Change the number of weeks to fewer than 24 and book the remaining weeks directly with the school. If you still don’t find an available offer you may change the start date or the city. If your start date or city cannot be changed then it is recommended to visit often for new offers."}, {title: "Marketing", q: "Can eslBooking contact me whenever a new offer is uploaded for a particular school?", a: "Promotional e-mails are sent out weekly highlighting the newest deals available."}, {title: "Marketing", q: "How will I know when a new offer is available?", a: "Simply check back daily as new offers will be posted on a daily basis."}, {title: "Sale", q: "Is there a maximum number of offers that I can make at any given time?", a: "No. You can make as many you like."}, {title: "Strategy", q: "Why eslBooking is by Invitation only?", a: "Because the concept of eslBooking offers limited opportunities the demand has been greater than expected. Therefore, the IWL-Invitation Waiting List is our way to protect the ESL community from negative competition."}] %>
